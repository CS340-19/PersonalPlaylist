Introduction:

Personal Playlist is web-based python algorithm that uses Spotify's API to generate a curated playlist based on your listening history or inputted artists and songs. The website will allow users to adjust the search parameters based on what they're looking for, and the algorithm will learn and improve from user feedback.

Customer Value:

1) Customer Need 

- Primarily, customers of Custom Concert are looking for a quick and simple way to create playlists curated to thier Spotify profile or genre(s) of choice. We would like to create an easy, fast, and intuitive way for Spotify users to create playlists, whether it be by artist, genre, popularity, mood, tempo, and much more.

- Custom Concert aims to remove the frustration of individually adding songs to your playlist inside of the Spotify application. Tediously searching for each song and remembering what song that fits the playlist's vibe is a thing of the past. We want the user experience to be as simple and intuitive as possible. We want the playlist creation process to be simple while also being able to create complex and highly specific playlists.

- Custom Concert compete's with other web applications using Spotify's API such as Rekl.be, Dubolt, Playlist Miner, and Sort Your Music. Rekl.be creates a connection between users by creating a curated playlist based on Spotify likes within a group. People can be added to the group and as a result the playlist evolves. In Custom Concert, we plan to adopt the idea of user interaction by allowing playlists curated based on who is going to listen to them. Dubolt and Playlist Miner, use keywords, genre, and other attributes of the wanted playlist to create a playlist within the Spotify app. We see Dubolt and Playlist Miner as our main competetion in the market and we plan on making a playlist app that can create Spotify playlists in the same manner but more quickly and intuitively using GUI.

2) Proposed Solution

- Custom Consert aims to allow the the user a seemless and intuitive way to create playlists with the use of GUI. We plan on using methods such as sliders to adjust mood, tempo, popularity, and more. We would also like to create a playlist sort function with in the app to allow users to sort the playlist they are creating based on specific attributes. As a result the user should recieve a quality playist based on the attributes the user input and this should all be done a simple and quick manner. 

3) Measures of Success

- Our main goal of this project it to make the process of creating a playlist on Spotify quick with a simple and natural experience. If customers can create playlists that successfully reflect the the playlist they wanted in a matter of seconds we have successfully completed our main goal of this project.


Technology:

1) What will our software do?

- You can connect to your Spotify profile through the app. This will allow the user to manipulate their profile and create/edit playlists they own. 

- You can create playlists based on attributes. These attribute will be assigned to each song and will be used to sort and search for songs as well as find connections to other songs through related attributes. Once the songs are found, a playlist will be created reflecting the attributes you have chosen. 

- You can create playlists based on searching artists and the software will find music that the artist made as well as music made by related or similar artists. You can then change the attributes of the whole playlist with in the scope of the artists' genre. 

- You can sort playlists that are being created based on any attributes you would like to be at the top of the playlist. 

2) What are the main components of the system? What will you use to build the system?

- Our experience will be discussed more later in the proposal but I think it is important to highlight that we have never developed a web application so much of this is subject to change during our first sprint.

- We plan on having a client and server component to our application. The client side will be implemented using Javascript and CSS. We plan on using these languages and few API's to create a seemless user experience. It is important for our team to make this process quick and easy. The server side will mainly be written in Python but I can see us possibly using C++ because we are all very familiar with the language. The server side of this app will be used to connect users to their Spotify account and process search results and changes in attribute sliders. The back end will be doing all of the algorithmic processes to create the list of songs as well as implementing the changes with in the user's Spotify profile such as adding a playlist.
