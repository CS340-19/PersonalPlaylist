Customer Value:

-Customer Need 
Primarily, customers of Custom Concert are looking for a quick and simple way to create playlists curated to thier Spotify profile or genre(s) of choice. We would like to create an easy, fast, and intuitive way for Spotify users to create playlists, whether it be by artist, genre, popularity, mood, tempo, and much more. 
Custom Concert aims to remove the frustration of individually adding songs to your playlist inside of the Spotify application. Tediously searching for each song and remembering what song that fits the playlist's vibe is a thing of the past. We want the user experience to be as simple and intuitive as possible. We want the playlist creation process to be simple while also being able to create complex and highly specific playlists. 
Custom Concert compete's with other web applications using Spotify's API such as Rekl.be, Dubolt, Playlist Miner, and Sort Your Music. Rekl.be creates a connection between users by creating a curated playlist based on Spotify likes within a group. People can be added to the group and as a result the playlist evolves. In Custom Concert, we plan to adopt the idea of user interaction by allowing playlists curated based on who is going to listen to them. Dubolt and Playlist Miner, use keywords, genre, and other attributes of the wanted playlist to create a playlist within the Spotify app. We see Dubolt and Playlist Miner as our main competetion in the market and we plan on making a playlist app that can create Spotify playlists in the same manner but more quickly and intuitively using GUI.

-Proposed Solution
Custom Consert aims to allow the the user a seemless and intuitive way to create playlists with the use of GUI. We plan on using methods such as sliders to adjust mood, tempo, popularity, and more. We would also like to create a playlist sort function with in the app to allow users sort the playlist they are creating based on specific attributes. As a result the user should recieve a quality playist based on the attributes the user input and this should all be done a simple and quick manner. 
-Measures of Success
Our main goal of this project it to make the process of creating a playlist on Spotify quickly with a simple and natural experience. If customers can create playlists that successfully reflect the the playlist they wanted in a matter of seconds we have successfully completed our main goal of this project.
