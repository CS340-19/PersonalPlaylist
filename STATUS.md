<h2>Team:</h2>
Our team decided to split up our current work and research into two seperate categories. Tucker Wheaton and Mathew Butera focused on creating the front end design for the web application and plan to continue researching ways to implement a solid backend. Chris Mobely and Lane Henslee focused their attention on creating a Python based algorithm that works with Spotify's API to create lists of curated playlists based on a user's Spotify account information.
