<h2>Introduction: </h2> 

<h2>Customer Value:</h2>
<p>Our main goal of this project is to make the process of creating a playlist on Spotify quick with a simple and natural experience. If customers can create playlists that successfully reflect the playlist they wanted in a matter of seconds, we have successfully completed our main goal of this project. Our goal and the value of the application to the customer has not changed since the creation of or proposal at the begginning of the semester.</p>

<h2>Technology:</h2>

<h2>Team:</h2>
<p> We decided to split up our current work and research into two seperate categories. We did this as we could see a clear divide in our research process. Half of our group researched the Spotify API and used Python to fiddle with some of its features while the other half researched ways to implement a web application. During our first iteration, Tucker Wheaton and Mathew Butera focused on creating the front end design for the web application and plan to continue researching ways to implement a solid back end. Chris Mobely and Lane Henslee focused their attention on creating a Python based algorithm that works with Spotify's API to create a curated list of songs based on a user's Spotify account information.

As we get closer to implementing the backend of our web application, our team plans to work more closely together to integrate our Python algorithm with the internal playlist creation of the web application.

<h2>Project Management:</h2>
During our first iteration, we spent most of our time understanding Spotify's API and how to manipulate a user's metadata. Though we planned to finish the entire web application during the semester, we are concerned we will not have enough time to complete the back end of the website and integrate the python algorithm into the web application. Since many of our team members have never created a web application, we did not expect the tremendous learning curve and the amount of time we would need to research and implement our design. We are hopeful that we will have a working web application by the end of the semester but our team is confident our python algorithm will be able to create curated playlists based on the user's metadata.

In the next iteration, our team plans to setup a login system to allow user's to sign into thier Spotify account. We would like for the python algorithm to then allow the user to adjust thier curated playlist based on specific attributes(duration, key, danceability, energy, liveness, etc.) the Spotify API supports.
